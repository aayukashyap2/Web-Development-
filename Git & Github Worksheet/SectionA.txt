1. What problem does a Version Control System solve?
A VCS helps manage changes in code over time, allowing developers to track versions, collaborate easily, and roll back if needed.

2. Differentiate between Centralized and Distributed VCS.
Centralized VCS has a single server, while Distributed VCS like Git gives each user a full copy of the repo, allowing offline work.

3. What is Git and how is it different from GitHub?
Git is a local version control tool; GitHub is a cloud platform to store and collaborate on Git repositories.

4. What is a staging area in Git?
The staging area is where changes are kept before they are committed to the repository.

5. What does the .git folder contain?
It stores all Git data like commits, branches, logs, and configurations of the repo.

6. What is git branching and command to create new branch and switching from one to another branch
Branching lets you work on features independently.
Use: git branch <name> and git checkout <name> or git switch <name>.

7. What is the difference between git reset and git reset --hard?
git reset keeps your changes unstaged, while git reset --hard deletes all uncommitted changes.

8. What is a squash merge, and when would you use it?
Squash merge combines multiple commits into one. Use it for cleaner history before merging a feature branch.

9. Explain the use of git rebase with an example scenario.
git rebase moves your branch to the tip of another.
Use it to apply feature branch commits over updated main
